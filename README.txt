This script logs into LingQ and then imports the files one by one from the desired folder.

In main.py enter the webadress to the language library you want to import into.
You also need to enter your mail and password.

To remove the possibility of any duplicates in your LingQ course, the script moves the file from source folder into an archive folder.

The option too_long_filenames can be set to zero if you dont want the file names to be changed. 
This option shortens the file names to 60 charachters, so that LingQ can import the file and use the file name as the title for the lesson.

Also the "chinese_or_japanese_only" option is for removing any letters in the file name that is not japanese or chinese.
